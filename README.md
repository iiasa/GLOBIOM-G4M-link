# GLOBIOM-G4M-link

R script to automatize the link between GLOBIOM and G4M.

## Dependencies

`xl2gdx.R` depends on:
- The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) curated R package collection.
- [**gdxrrw**](https://github.com/GAMS-dev/gdxrrw), an R package for
  reading/writing GDX files from R. For a list of which binary package versions
  match what R versions, see the [**gdxrrw** wiki](https://github.com/GAMS-dev/gdxrrw/wiki).
  * **Beware**, as of version V1.0.8, **gdxrrw** requires GAMS >= V33.
    When you use an earlier GAMS version, use an earlier **gdxrrw** version.
  * Note that if you can compile packages, for example with [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/),
    any source package version can be made to work with your R version.
  * If you don't want to go through the hassle of installing Rtools, try a binary
    package built for a slightly earlier R release than the one you have installed.
    A package built for R version x.y.a may work with R version x.y.b (where x, y, a,
    and b are digits and a < b), though possibly with some warnings.
- [**gdxtools**](https://github.com/lolow/gdxtools).
